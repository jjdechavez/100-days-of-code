//##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: I just learned JWT authentication and add to my mini-project.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with developing fullstack app, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly progress on doing fullstack. So I decided break into pieces the fullstack of MERN.

### Day 2: September 12, 2019 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Plan to create a small BlogApp.

**Thoughts**: My progress: I already create a serverside for registration for User. Right now I'm planning to design a registration page, I'm trying to figure  out if I'm going to use a framework or just plain CSS.

### Day 3: September 13, 2019 Friday

**Today's Progress**: I'm stuck on designing for frontend and decided to use framework like reactstrap.

**Thoughts** So I decided to refresh my mind and make a tasklist :
1. Responsive Design with CSS
2. React lifecycles.

### Day 4: September 14, 2019 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Grind ReactJS

**Thoughts** It's good to review some fundamentals of React with the tutorial prepared by Bob Ziroll

I almost done the course, and I learn a lot

### Day 5: September 15, 2019 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Enhancing Frontend stuff

**Thoughts** Today I'm way rusty on designing, that's why I tried to focus on HTML and CSS like:

1. Responsive
2. Animations
3. Keyframes

### Day 6: September 16, 2019 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Still working on Frontendstuff

**Thoughts** I really enjoyed applying the animation for my weather app. And I can't believe tons of people saw it and like my work.

### Day 7: September 17, 2019 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've been working on my portfolio

**Thoughts** I struggled on design for mobile view port. But I really enjoyed the colors that I used Black&White and some flat colors.

### Day 8: September 18, 2019 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Discover and play with it using pos

**Thoughts** The things that I learned:
- Position property: During the design sesh, instead using margin and padding properties on placing and move an element, use  the Position property then use the property left, top, right property to move those elements.

### Day 9: September 20, 2019 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Work with portfolio

**Thoughts** Got a problem working with CSS grid and I think I'm going to redo those grids.

For now I'm going to jump to another project with react.

### Day 10: September 21, 2019 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Enjoyed Context API on ReactJS

**Thoughts** Which provides the way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass the props down manually at every level.

Still the same with redux but the structure of context api is easy to understand.Any pros&cons of it?
