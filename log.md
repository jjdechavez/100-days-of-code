**Today's Progress**: Plan to create a small BlogApp.

**Thoughts**: My progress: I already create a serverside for registration for User. Right now I'm planning to design a registration page, I'm trying to figure  out if I'm going to use a framework or just plain CSS.

**Today's Progress**: I'm stuck on designing for frontend and decided to use framework like reactstrap.

2. React lifecycles.
